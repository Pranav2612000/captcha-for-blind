### Ministry Category – DTE of IT and Cyber Security, DRDO 

### Problem Statement – CAPTCHA / Alternative Solution for Visually impaired 

### Problem Code – CK146


### Introduction: 
< Basic Introduction>
We are team Neoteric from College of engineering Pune and our problem statement is to propose alternative authentication mechanisms for visually impaired users.

### Defects with Current Captcha:
* Difficulty in figuring out letters and words, for the visually impaired and dyslexic
* Difficulty in understanding the audio due to accents, and similar background noise 


### Types of Captcha:
